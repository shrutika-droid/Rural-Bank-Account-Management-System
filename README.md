# Rural Bank Account Management System (RBAMS)

The **Rural Bank Account Management System (RBAMS)** is a console-based Java application designed to provide basic banking services (savings and current accounts) for rural areas of Nepal. It is built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure simplicity, security, and efficiency. The system helps manage multiple accounts per customer, apply interest, and handle overdraft and transaction rules. Custom exceptions handle real-world banking errors like insufficient balance.

| Class Name              | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BankAccount`           | Abstract class with common properties (account number, balance, etc.)      |
| `SavingsAccount`        | Inherits from `BankAccount`; supports interest addition                    |
| `CurrentAccount`        | Inherits from `BankAccount`; supports overdraft                            |
| `Customer`              | Aggregates multiple `BankAccount` objects                                  |
| `InsufficientBalanceException` | Custom exception for withdrawal limit violations                     |

### ‚úÖ OOP Concepts Used

- **Abstraction**: `BankAccount` is an abstract base class.
- **Encapsulation**: Private variables with getters/setters.
- **Inheritance**: `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` inherit `BankAccount`.
- **Polymorphism**: Transactions handled generically via parent references.
- **Aggregation**: A `Customer` has multiple bank accounts.
